# powerful yet easy combinations of commands:
abline(lm(Volume ~ Girth), col = "red");

# Loss Matrix
# The next goal is to incorporate a loss matrix in to the classification tree: these are a parallel
# to the profit matrix from lectures. A loss matrix is used to weight misclassifications
# differently. In other words, different problems may mean that a false positive (type I error)
# and false negative (type II error) are not equally bad. For example, quite often in medical
# screening a false negative is far worse (we miss that the person has a disease) than a
# false positive (we suspect they have it when they donâ€™t and send for further testing). Our
# classification tree can take this into consideration by weighting how much to penalise each
# incorrect classification in a given choice of split.
# Note: due to the quirk of R ordering factors alphabetically, you need to be careful about the
# order of false positive and false negative in the above matrix. Here, our churn factor is
# yes/no, so no is first (â€˜nâ€™ being before â€˜yâ€™) and so the first row/column is actual/predicted
# for no.
# Fitting with a loss matrix
